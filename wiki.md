This repository will host all labs for GEOG 328, a variety of **web GIS methods** will be explored and implemented through these labs. Through this course I hope to achieve proficiency in the implementation and deployment of various GIS technologies.

## About Me
I am a senior finishing up my degree in **Geography: Data Science**. Throughout this next year I am aiming to become <u>industry viable</u> by working on personal projects and technical interview preparations! Some of my interests that I want to explore this year include:

1. Implementing cool geospatial maps into web applications
2. AI workflows and automation tasks
3. Self hosting servers and *"de googling"* my personal digital presence
